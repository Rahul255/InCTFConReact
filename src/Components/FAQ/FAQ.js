                    No. InCTF is a Capture The Flag Championship, which is a more practical hands-on computer security competition. Unlike quizzes, a participant will be working with actual tools & using problem solving skills to solve challenges and obtain a flag that earns them points.

                    Trainings & Contests are only for women (including non-binary people identifying as women) participants.

                <p>
                CTFs (Abbreviation for Capture The Flag) are a type of computer security competition. Contestants are presented with a set of challenges which test their creativity, technical (and googling) skills, and problem-solving ability. Challenges usually cover a number of categories, and when solved, each yields a string (called a flag) which is submitted to an online scoring service.
                </p>
                <p>
                CTFs are a great way to learn a wide array of computer security skills in a safe, legal environment, and are hosted and played by many security groups around the world for fun and practice.

                As this conference aims at bridging the diversity gap in the field of cybersecurity, there will be a
                verification process on an individual basis to validate participantâ€™s identity before being allowed
                to participate in InCTFCon trainings. You will get more details regarding this once you sign

                You can start learning by going through the basics of each category given on bi0s wiki.
                Also, there are many video lectures you can watch explaining basic challenges on Amrita InCTF Junior .
                You can also practice challenges on bi0s-archive. Additionally, you can google and find many more
                resources on any individual topic you are interested in. We encourage lots of independent learning!
